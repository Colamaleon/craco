/**
 * An encryption scheme with the added ability to encrypt data from streams.
 * Natural examples are stream- and block ciphers (e.g., AES).
 * <p>
 * Example use (decrypts a file that is being read):
 * <pre>
 * scheme.decrypt(new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(...)), decryptionKey)
 * </pre>
 * returns an {@link InputStream} where reading supplies exactly the plaintext corresponding
 * to the ciphertext stored in the file.
 * <p>
 * The idea is that encryption/decryption can be used as part of a chain of streams.
 * In the example above: {@code FileInputStream -> BufferedInputStream -> DecryptionInputStream}.
 * Similarly, you can chain {@code OutputStream}s such that any bytes written to it are encrypted/decrypted
 * and then passed to another {@code OutputStream}.
 * <p>
 * Note that the plaintext size and ciphertext size are often NOT the same, hence you cannot
 * expect the chained streams obtained from a {@code StreamingEncryptionScheme} to read/write
 * exactly the number of bytes from the chained stream that you read from/write to it.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface should normally be able to do
 * encryption and decryption without loading the whole plaintext/ciphertext into memory.
