/**
 * A PredicateEncryptionScheme is an advanced form of EncryptionScheme
 * where ciphertexts can be read by a whole well-defined set of
 * key holders. (One special case is attribute-based encryption).
 * <p>
 * The general idea is that a concrete scheme employs a predicate P (cf. getPrediate())
 * and a master secret key that is generally computed during setup (for which there is no common interface and which
 * depends on the scheme).
 * Consider the following process:
 * sk = generateDecryptionKey(masterSecret, keyIndex);
 * pk = generateEncryptionKey(ciphertextIndex);
 * c = encrypt(m, pk);
 * m' = decrypt(c, sk);
 * <p>
 * Correctness says that if P(keyIndex, ciphertextIndex) = 1, then m' = m.
 * Security says that if P(keyIndex, ciphertextIndex) = 0, then the holder of sk cannot decrypt c.
 * <p>
 * Hence at encryption time, a user can choose ciphertextIndex to determine which group of
 * key holders should be able to decrypt the encrypted message.
 * <p>
 * One special case of predicate encryption is attribute-based encryption.
 * See the class AbePredicate for more details.
