## Craco

Craco (CRyptogrAphic COnstructions) is a Java library providing implementations of various cryptographic primitives and low-level constructions. This includes primitives such as commitment schemes, signature schemes, and much more.

The goal of Craco is to provide common cryptographic schemes for usage in more high-level protocols as well as to offer facilities for improving the process of implementing more low-level schemes such as signature and encryption schemes.

## Security Disclaimer
**WARNING: This library is meant to be used for prototyping and as a research tool *only*. It has not been sufficiently vetted for use in security-critical production environments. All implementations are to be considered experimental.**
